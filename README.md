# Advent Of Code 2023

These are my original solutions for the advent of code 2023 challenges. For each challenge the idea is to pick a language that suits the challenge the best (haskell for more parsing-heavy days, c++ for more random access lists, etc), but sometimes I just pick random languages for whatever

Maybe will try OCaml at some point to have best of both haskell and c++ worlds but idk
